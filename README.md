# Elements
A small program to make memorizing the elements of the periodic table easy that I threw together in like 15 minutes

## Usage
- Run `./elements.py` in the terminal (you may have to run `chmod +x elements.py` first)
- Type the number, followed by the name and the element symbol for each element in order.
For example: 1 Hydrogen H
- The program will tell you when you are wrong, and if you are wrong it will send you back a set number of elements and tell you what the correct answer was. This makes memorization very easy.
- To modify settings, modify the python file to your desires
- The program will time you and display your time at the end. Have fun, and speedrun it if you want!
- Turn on hardcore mode to reset back to Hydrogen every time you mess up
- To quit, press `ctrl+C`
