# Elements
A small program to make memorizing the elements of the periodic table easy

## Usage
- Run `./elements.py` in the terminal
- Type the number, followed by the name and the element symbol for each element in order.
For example: 1 Hydrogen H
- The program will tell you when you are wrong, and if you are wrong it will send you back a set number of elements and tell you what the correct answer was. This makes memorization very easy.
- To modify settings, modify the python file to your desires
